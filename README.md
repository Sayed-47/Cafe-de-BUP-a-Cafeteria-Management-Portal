# Cafe de BUP - a Cafeteria Management Portal

This C project aims to streamline the management of multiple cafeterias within a college or university setting. Given that item prices and quantities can vary between different cafeterias, this system allows cafeteria authorities to efficiently manage and serve high-quality food items. Additionally, it enables students to check the availability and reviews of food items, ensuring they have access to the best options available.


## Features

- Multi-Cafeteria Management: Handle multiple cafeterias with varying item prices and quantities.
- Quality Control: Ensure the provision of high-quality food items.
- Real-Time Availability: Students can check the availability of food items in real-time.
- Review System: Students can read and leave reviews for food items, helping others make informed choices.
